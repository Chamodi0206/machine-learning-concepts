Machine Learning Concepts

This repository contains various practical implementations of core Machine Learning concepts. Each notebook covers a different ML topic, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

üìÇ Contents
1. Housing Price Prediction (HousingPrice.ipynb)

In this notebook, we explore regression techniques to predict housing prices based on various features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and more.
Practical Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Model Training: Implement various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) to predict the price of houses.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to determine the best-performing model.

2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (PrincipalComponentAnalysis.ipynb)

This notebook demonstrates the use of PCA for dimensionality reduction. PCA is useful for reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining most of the variance.
Practical Steps:

Data Exploration: Visualize the dataset and assess the need for dimensionality reduction based on feature correlation.
Apply PCA: Use PCA to reduce the feature space and visualize how it affects the dataset.
Modeling: Compare the performance of machine learning models before and after dimensionality reduction to see how PCA influences the model‚Äôs efficiency.

3. Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Support_Vector_Machine.ipynb)

This notebook focuses on implementing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification tasks, particularly binary classification.
Practical Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale the data.
Model Training: Train an SVM classifier on a labeled dataset, tuning hyperparameters like the kernel type and regularization parameter (C).
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other classification metrics.

4. Titanic Survival Prediction (titanic.ipynb)

The Titanic dataset is used to predict passenger survival using classification models. It is a classic example of a binary classification problem.
Practical Steps:

Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand the features that may influence survival, such as age, gender, and class.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by filling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Model Training: Train different classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Evaluation: Use cross-validation and classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to evaluate model performance.

5. Unsupervised Learning (UnsupervisedLearning.ipynb)

This notebook covers various unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering and anomaly detection. We will implement algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering.
Practical Steps:

Data Exploration: Examine the dataset and identify patterns that can be uncovered without labeled data.
Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms like K-Means to group similar data points and visualize the clusters.
Evaluation: Assess the quality of clusters using metrics such as Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.
